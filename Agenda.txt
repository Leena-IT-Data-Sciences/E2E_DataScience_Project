  Creating a new environment
  ----------------------------
  1. Create a folder name 'venv' and install all packages, libraries etc. 
      - install anaconda in your system.
      - Add the below given paths to the environment variables - System variables section. 
         - C:\Users\HP\anaconda3
         - C:\Users\HP\anaconda3\Scripts
         - $ conda --version 
      - To create a environment with name 'venv', use the below command:- 
         - $ conda create -p venv python==3.12.2 
      - To activate our environment, use the following commands:- 
         - $ conda init
         - $ conda activate  - Activating our environment 

2. Create new repository in github and give a connection from vscode to github with git commands.
3. Create a .gitignore file in github and pull it to our project. 
4. Create a requirements.txt file and add the packages to it. 
5. Run requirements.txt file with the following command:- 
    - $ pip install -r requirements.txt
6. Create a setup.py file and add the code to it.
7. Run the setup.py file with the following command:-
    - $ python setup.py install 
8. We can run setup.py file in another way. 
9. Add '-e.' in requirements.txt file and save it. 
10. Add 'if' code in 'setup.py' file.
11. Now instead of running 'setup.py' file, Run 'requirements.txt' file as follows:-
    - $ pip install -r requirements.txt
